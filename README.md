# ImageScaler
You are provided with a simple graphical user interface that uses your code to display an
image, change its resolution, and find pixels with similar colors. To run the program from
the terminal, place all the java files and images in the same directory. Compile the
program by typing: javac Gui.java. Then run the program by typing: java Gui file_name,
where file_name is the name of an image file. The image file must have size at least 512
× 512 and at most 2048 × 2048.
